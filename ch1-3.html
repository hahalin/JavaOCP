Which of the following statements about unary operators are true? (Choose all that apply.)

Unary operators are always executed before any surrounding binary or ternary operators.
The - operator can be used to flip a boolean value.

The post-decrement operator (--) returns the value of the variable before the decrement is applied.
The ! operator cannot be used on numeric values.
None of the above
